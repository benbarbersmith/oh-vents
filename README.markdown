# oh!vents: Events organisation, Twitter-style.

This is a Rails-rewrite of [*oh!vents*](http://ohvents.com/), my in-development events organisation webapp that uses Twitter to create events, invite guests, and RSVP. 

oh!vents is the #secretproject of [benjaminasmith](http://www.benjaminasmith.com/).
